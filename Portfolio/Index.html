    <h2> Music</h2>
                One of my favorite activities to do in my spare time is to listen to music. I love making music, listening to music, and analyzing music. The headphones to the right are my favorite headphones and the headphones ive used to analyze music for a long time are called the hifiman aryas. They are wonderful for listening, analyzing, and even making music.

    <h2>Video games</h2>  
            I have been collecting videogames since I was a young child. Although I have sold most of my videogames from the past I still have a small collection. My favorite consoles are gamecube and ps2 and my favorite way to play games in on pc. 
            I also love to mod consoles and I have 2 modded switches, a modded 3ds, and a modded gamecube. I like playing everything form RPG'S to strategy games, roguelites, FPS shooters, etc.
